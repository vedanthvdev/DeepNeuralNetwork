# DeepNeuralNetwork
Classification model using deep neural network algorithm

1) This project already has the testing and training data
2) The data is being collected from googleapi for tensorflow
3) You can enable the venv by "source ./venv/bin/activate" when inside this repo
4) can run the project by "python classificationModel.py"
5) you can manipulate the data and try to play with it to see how the accuracy of the model changes with diffent iterations of the filter
